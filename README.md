**Project Description** - This project allows users to look at contact information, insert, edit, and delete contact information. Users are able to input the first name, last name, an email address, and a note to create a contact(first,last name are the required filed, cannt be empty!). The contact ID will be automatically generated as the unique auothorized key. When user open/click any record, site will generate current local time, these two filed only present on 'contact page'

**Development Environment** 
1: MacBook Air Apple M2 

2: Node JS version v20.5.1 

3: GitHub Desktop 

4: Visual Studio Code

**Insight and Resaults** - Everything seems worked smooth, one of the small issue I found is the "Last Opened" filed. The time supposed to present the last seconds you edited your record, rather than the real time  when I clicked my records. If I did not edit anything, the time will be presented last second I created. Need to figure it out in the next few days.

**Installation/Running Instructions** â€“ In order to run the app, you are going to have to make sure NodeJS is installed. Once it is installed, you would then need to clone this repository and place it wherever you want. Next, you are going to need to open your command line and go to the directory of the cloned repository. Once there you are going to need to type *npm i* to install the dependencies. Next, you need to type: npm run start/dev. Finally, you can type Localhost:3000 to see the index.
